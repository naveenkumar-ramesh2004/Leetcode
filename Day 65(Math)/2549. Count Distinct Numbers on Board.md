## [2549. Count Distinct Numbers on Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-distinct-numbers-on-board/description/)

Hint 1
For n > 2, n % (n - 1) == 1 thus n - 1 will be added on the board the next day.

Hint 2
As the operations are performed for so long time, all the numbers lesser than n except 1 will be added to the board.

Hint 3
What will happen if n == 1?

```
class Solution {
    public int distinctIntegers(int n) {
        return (n==1)?1:n-1;
    }
}
