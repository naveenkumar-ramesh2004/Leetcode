## [1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/description/)

###⭐ Why is this correct? Simple English
✔ `left = max(weights)`

Ship must be able to carry at least the largest package.

✔ `right = sum(weights)`

Ship could deliver everything in 1 day.

✔ `mid = capacity we are testing`
✔ canShip(mid) checks:

If capacity = mid, can we finish in ≤ days?

✔ If canShip(mid) = true

Try reducing capacity → `right = mid`

✔ If canShip(mid) = false

Capacity too small → `left = mid + 1`

✔ loop ends when `left == right`

That is the minimum working capacity.

```
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int max=0;
        int min=-1;
        for(int val:weights){
            min=Math.max(min,val);
            max+=val;
        }
        return findMinBanaEat(weights,days,min,max);
    }
    int findMinBanaEat(int[] nums,int t,int start,int end){
        int ans=-1;
        while(start<end){
            int mid = start+(end-start)/2;
            int sum=0;
            int count=1;
            for(int value:nums){
              if(value+sum<=mid){
                sum+=value;
              }
              else{
                count++;
                sum=value;
              }
              if(count>t){break;}
            
            }
            if(count<=t){
                end=mid;
                ans=mid;
            }
            else{
                start=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
